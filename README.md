Simon Game
A web-based implementation of the classic Simon game, where players need to remember and replicate sequences of colors displayed on the screen.

Description
The Simon Game is a memory game that tests your ability to remember a sequence of colors. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons. As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.

Features
• Four colored buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow) that light up in a specific sequence.
• Each round, the game adds one new color to the sequence.
• Players must repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level.
• If the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly, the game displays a "Game Over" message and resets.
• The game uses jQuery for dynamic effects and user interactions.

Technologies Used
• HTML: For structuring the game layout.
• CSS: For styling the game, including animations for button effects.
• JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.
• jQuery: To simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.

How to Play
- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the sequence of colors that light up.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
- The sequence will increase by one color every round. Continue to repeat the sequence to advance.
- If you click the wrong button, the game will display "Game Over," and you can restart by pressing a key again.
